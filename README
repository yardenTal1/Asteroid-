I discussed the exercise with:

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
* a class of a spaceship for asteroids game
* a class of an asteroid
* a class of a torpedo
* runs an asteroids game, has one spaceship that can shoot torpedoes at asteroids until all asteroids
 are gone before they hit you and ship life is ended
======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
* we chose to define the move function in asteroids_main. the alternative option was to move each
  object in their own class. it's advantage is that you don't have to assume all object classes have the same
  coordinates structure and get and set functions. we chose the other option because we wrote the other classes and
  a same structure is  more convenient and clear.
* we chose to use a list for objects in the game. the alternative option was to use a dictionary. it's advantage is
  that you could store all asteroid information in the dictionary instead of calling each one with a function.
  we chose a list because it uses less memory, we don't need all information all the time.
* we chose to use a tuple for x and y coordinates and speed at each axis. the alternative option is to use
  parameters for each one. it's advantage is that you can call the parameter directly and won't have to unpack
  a tuple. we chose to use a tuple because they are immutable, so it prevents unwanted changes.
